        <h4>From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The Simple English Wikipedia is an English-language version of Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia, that is written at a basic level of English.[1] It was created on September 18, 2001.[2]
<br>
            All of the articles in the Simple English Wikipedia use shorter sentences and easier words and grammar than the regular English Wikipedia.[3] This makes articles easier to understand and edit.
            <br>
            The Simple English Wikipedia is often used by:</p>
<ul>
            <li> <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student" target="blank">Students</a> </li>   <br> 
            
            <li> <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children" target="blank">Children</a> </li> 
             <br> 
            
            <li> <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult" target="blank">Adults</a> with <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_disability" target="blank">learning disabilities</a> </li>
            <br> 
                 <li>  <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_a_second_language" target="blank">Non-native English speakers</a> </li>
                
                 </ul>

                <br>
        
                <p>Technical subjects often use terms that are not simple although many articles are shorter than English version. Editors try to explain these terms in a simple way. This makes Simple English articles a good way to understand difficult articles from the ordinary English Wikipedia. If someone cannot understand an idea in complex English, they can read the Simple English article.

                    When the Simple English Wikipedia started creation of pages and allowing changes in 2003, the ordinary English Wikipedia already had 150,000 articles. Seven other Wikipedias in other languages also had over 15,000 articles. Because the other Wikipedias already have so many articles, most Simple English articles are not new. They are usually simplified versions of already existing articles from the ordinary English Wikipedia. Right now, the Simple English Wikipedia has 207,717 articles. Simple English Wikipedia is the 49th largest Wikipedia as of February 2022.[4]</p>
